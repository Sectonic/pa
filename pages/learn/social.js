              <p>
              Humans evolved to group together as tribes. The inherent need for each other is what kept us together and alive. 
              That is how social hierarchies formed. People are motivated to fulfill their own roles as part of a larger structure.
              </p>
              <p>
              What we'll be taking a look at here has nothing to do with certain people being "Better" than others. It purely has to do with what kind of spot in the group you insinctively fit yourself into.

              What's being tracked here is which position in the tribe you're instinctively taking. Not what you value or find socially appealing.
              </p>
              <p>
              There's a best life and success out there for every type. Being one type does not make you better than any other, it's just a matter of which role you naturally function in.

              (Ego) is slightly Di motivated as it puts itself above others in the social structure and aims for the top, as opposed to equalizing and leveling the playing field with others.
